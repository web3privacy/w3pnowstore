## Enabling checkout

By default, the checkout functionality is disabled to prevent transactions in non-production environments. To enable the checkout flow for local development, you need to uncomment the code found in the `OnchainStoreCart.tsx` component, along with the imports at the top of the file.

You can also remove the `OnchainStoreModal` component and logic as well as the `MockCheckoutButton` as these were created for demo purposes only. 

Next, you'll want to replace `products` in the `OnchainStoreProvider` with your own product items. 


>This template showcases a multi-product checkout implementation of our `Checkout` component using the `chargeHandler` approach. You can read more about this implementation in the Advanced Usage section of our `Checkout` component docs here: https://onchainkit.xyz/checkout/checkout
